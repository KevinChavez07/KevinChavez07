# 👋 Hi, I'm Kevin Jair Chávez Castro

🎮 Software & Game Developer  
🧩 Focused on gameplay systems and interactive solutions  

I work with **Unreal Engine (Blueprints)** and **Unity (C#)**, with a strong foundation
in C++, JavaScript and HTML/CSS. My interest is centered on building clear,
functional systems for games and software.

I approach development with a professional mindset, focusing on structure,
readability and continuous improvement. I’m currently refining my workflow
and preparing projects to be presented at a production-ready level.
