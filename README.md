# 👋 Hi, I'm Kevin Jair Chávez Castro

🎮 Software & VideoGames Developer with a strong interest in interactive systems  
🧠 Focused on gameplay logic, structure and clean solutions  

I enjoy building things that make sense — systems that feel responsive,
well-organized and easy to understand. My work is mainly focused on
**Unreal Engine (Blueprints)** and **Unity (C#)**, supported by a solid
foundation in C++, JavaScript and HTML/CSS.

I approach development with a professional mindset, taking care of structure,
readability and long-term maintainability. I value clear communication,
consistent progress and continuous learning as part of my daily workflow.

At the moment, I’m refining my development process and preparing projects
to be presented with a polished, production-ready standard.
